\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents a detailed outline of the design process for a rotating climbing surface, emphasizing the mechanical design principles integrated with electronic and computer system engineering. The project's primary aim is to design and manufacture a rotating climbing surface capable of providing a facility for extended-duration indoor climbing.

\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem_definition}

This project aims to develop a rotating climbing surface capable of rotating at a constant, user-defined speed and adjustable incline. The system must exhibit precise control over both speed and incline, as well as incorporate safety measures for user safety.

Key aspects of the project include the design and implementation of robust mechanical and electronic systems to facilitate smooth operation, integrating sensor technologies for accurate speed and inclination detection, and developing an intuitive and simplistic user interface for seamless interaction.

The rotating climbing surface should also adhere to stringent safety guidelines to mitigate potential hazards associated with operation. This encompasses utilizing calculations and simulations to ensure structural integrity, as well as a series of load tests that will need to be passed.

\section{Subsystem Identification and Selection}
\label{sec:concept_selection}

Based on the specified requirements and specifications of the rotating climbing surface, several key subsystems are crucial for the design and implementation of the system.

\subsection{Subsystem Identification}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Inclination Adjustment System:} Allows the inclination of the rotating climbing surface to be adjusted to vary difficulty levels.
    \item \textbf{Braking System:} Responsible for controlling the rate of rotation, thus controlling the speed of the climbing surface. The speed should be constant and smooth.
    \item \textbf{Rotating Surface:} The physical surface that rotates, allowing climbing holds to be mounted on it.
    \item \textbf{Control System and User Interface:} Serves as the connection between the user's preferences and the control of inclination and speed. It must be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling clear adjustment control over the necessary parameters.
    \item \textbf{Safety System:} Able to cut power to all high-power electronics and allow rotation to come to a rapid stop as soon as the emergency stop button is activated. The system should also ensure that all electronics and moving parts are enclosed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional Decomposition}

The functional requirements detailed previously outline the actions the rotating climbing wall system must perform from the stakeholders' perspective. In this section, these requirements are further decomposed to identify the internal functions the system must execute. Figure~\ref{fig:functional-decomp} illustrates the flow of energy, information, and materials to and from the functions that consume, generate, or transform these flows within the rotating climbing wall system.

\section{Concept Development}

\subsection{Inclination Adjustment System}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

The inclination adjustment system allows for altering the climbing angle of the wall, making it more beginner-friendly with less steep angles or more challenging with overhangs for advanced climbers and intense training sessions. This subsystem addresses FR2 (Incline control and adjustment) and PR2 and PR3 from the performance requirements.

\section{Integration of Subsystems}

The selected concepts for each subsystem are designed to work cohesively within the overall system. The frame structure integrates the inclination adjustment system, braking system, and rotating surface. The frame must accommodate the dimensions specified (PR6 and PR7) and provide mounting points for the mechanical components.

\subsection{Frame Structure}

The frame is constructed using steel beams sized according to the chosen dimensions (approximately 1.6\,m width and 2.9\,m height). All shaft widths, upright beams, crossbeams, and other structural components are designed based on these dimensions. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) will be conducted to ensure structural integrity under the expected loads.

\section{Conclusion}

Through a rigorous concept development and evaluation process, the preferred concepts for each of the main subsystems have been selected:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inclination Adjustment System:} IAS3 (Worm Gear Automatic Inclination)
    \item \textbf{Braking System:} BS3 (Electromagnetic Braking System)
    \item \textbf{Rotating Surface:} RS1 (Conveyor Chain-Driven Panels)
\end{itemize}

These selections are justified based on their performance against the defined criteria, alignment with stakeholder and engineering requirements, and their ability to integrate effectively within the overall system design.

Future work will focus on detailed design, including precise calculations, simulations, and integration of the control and safety systems.
