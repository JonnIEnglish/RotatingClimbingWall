\chapter{Conclusions}

The sport of rock climbing is growing quickly, and with the increase in professional athletes and competitions (especially the Olympic Games), there is a greater demand for more effective ways to train. This project looks at the feasibility of developing a rotating climbing wall that can be used by rock climbers wanting to train harder and  longer routes with limited vertical space. Investigation into current designs will take place, leading to the development of a final design and manufacture of a functional prototype. \\\\
All the expertise required to successfully complete this project is available to the team involved. The expected total costs are R330,600 over the 8 month expected period. Risks that may hinder the project's ability to be completed are outlined below and mitigation measures have been discussed.
